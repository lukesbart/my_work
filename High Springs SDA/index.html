        <p class="lead text-center">Welcome</p>
        <p class="w-text">As you become aquainted with High Springs SDA Church and Living Springs Academy (our church school) you will also become aware of the emphasis we are placing on individuals and families reading the Bible on a daily basis. God tells us in the Bible
            that faith comes by hearing God's Word, that is, by reading our Bibles on a daily basis we can build our faith stronger. It is what you do on a day to day basis to build your faith that will empower you to live life to the full (John 10:10,
            NIV), now and forever. I hope you will take time, even if you have to schedule it, to listen to God though His word, to talk with Him through prayer, and to look for what He is doing around you every day.</p>
        <p class="w-text">As you look around and see things that are not the way they should be, join us this year as we seek to focus on living life to the full by doing something positive in our world, community, and family to "overcome evil with good" (Romans 12:21).
            You may wish to join us by participating in one of our Mission Families, Bible Study Groups, Sabbath School Classes, or Women's Ministry as we seek to demonstrate God's love to others in practical ways. We invite you to join God and us on
            His mission to the earth, especially to those around you, by becoming a mature disciple within a biblical community preparing for Christ's soon return.</p>
        <p class="w-text">Come and join us for worship and fellowship, for educational and missional opportunties, in a truly warm family environment. Our church has active ministries for all age groups and would love to have you and your family participate with us in
            an environment of love and acceptance, a safe place for growing in your relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>
