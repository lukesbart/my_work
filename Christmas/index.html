            <h2>History of Christmas</h2>
            <p>Christmas is a Traditional American Holiday with roots in European Christian Traditions. Christmas comes from two Anglo-Saxon words literally meaning Christ’s Mass. Christmas originated from the Catholic Missal celebration of the birth of Christ.</p>

            <h2>Traditions</h2>
            <p>Ever since settlers from all around the world arrived in the United States, American’s have shared several Christmas traditions such as, the Christmas Tree, Christmas dinner, the Snowman, and many tales of Santa, his reindeer, and his elves. Beginning in the 20th Century it became a tradition to listen to Christmas music on the radio. Many present day Americans will be well familiar with the Christmas music of Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, and many other American Pop artists.</p>

            <h2>Christmas Today</h2>
            <p>Christmas in the present United States has shifted away from its original theme of the celebration of the birth of Christ, and has instead moved to more secular and diverse themes like, Santa and his elves, traditional Christmas music, or just calling the time holiday season.</p>
